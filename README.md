Client application for the [RemotePointer Server](https://github.com/schorschii/RemotePointer-Server).

With RemotePointer you can use your smartphone to control your Linux, macOS or Windows computer's keyboard and mouse (using a touchpad). In addition to that, you can project a digital laser pointer dot on your screen or projector, which is controlled by the movement of your Android device. Furthermore, you can use your smartphone as barcode/QR code scanner for your computer.

The goal of this project is to provide a complete self-hosted open source remote control application without dependencies to external servers and without tracking.
